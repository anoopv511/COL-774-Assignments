# Assignment 1

## Linear Regression

- Files - 'Linear Regression.ipynb', 'linear.py'
- To run the script - python3 linear.py (From src/)
- Implemented Vanilla Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
- Plotted Contours and 3D surface of the error function and visualized the gradient descent algorithm

## Locally Weighted Linear Regression

- Files - 'Locally Weighted Linear Regression.ipynb', 'localweight.py'
- To run the script - python3 localweight.py (From src/)
- Implemented Locally Weighted Linear Regression and visualized the variations of curve fitting for various values of hyperparameter tau

## Logistic Regression

- Files - 'Logistic Regression.ipynb', 'logistic.py'
- To run the script - python3 logistic.py (From src/)
- Implemented Newton's method for optimizing logistic cost function

## Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

- Files - 'Gaussian Discriminant Analysis.ipynb', 'gda.py'
- To run the script - python3 gda.py (From src/)
- Implemented Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and visualized the variations of curve fitting by changing the assumptions about covariance matrices for the normal distributions
