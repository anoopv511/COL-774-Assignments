# Assignment 1

### Note: Download models from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ttNRngHx9KmTcJTcekBMuUSbgiMHcndi

## Naive Bayes

- Files - 'Naive Bayes.ipynb', 'nb.py', 'model*.py', 'run_nb.py'
- Implemented Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Implemented multiple features to improve accuracy of the Naive Bayes baseline model

## SVM

- Files - 'SVM.ipynb', 'mysvm.py', 'libsvm*.py', 'run_svm.py
- Implemented SVMs and support code to use LIBSVM package
- Used PegaSos Algorithm for optimization of SVM

### Instructions for Assignment Evaluation

- Download all the models from the specified link and place them in the submission folder.
- Use ./run.sh <Question_number> <model_number> <input_file_name> <output_file_name> for running the code.
- 'run_nb.py' and 'run_svm.py' are supporting files for running the script. Check them too for errors in specifying paths (If in any case).
- 'Report.pdf' has the detailed report about algorithms implemented and their performance.
- Include libsvm-3.22 folder in the source directory. (Do not delete this to save space)
