# Assignment 3

## Decision Tree

- Files - 'Decision Tree.ipynb', 'dtree.py'
- To run the script - python3 dtree.py (From src/)
- Implemented Decision Trees with Post-Pruning and Numerical feature handling
- Used Scikit-Learn library implementation of Decision Trees and Random Forests to compare with Decision Tree implementation

## Neural Networks

- Files - 'nn.py'
- To run the script - python3 nn.py (From src/)
- Implemented SGD for Neural Networks with sigmoid activations
- Compared Neural Network performance with Logisitc Regression (Scikit-Learn Implementation) and SVM (LIBSVM implementation)
